13603,Checked out this app in my quest to find good solution for combining calendar events and ta into single scrollable homescreen widget Unfortunately although the app has the option to repeat task from the completion date the functionality is broken For example scheduled my test task on Tuesday and set it to repeat every week from the completion date The app forced there to be day of the week listed in the repeat schedule so that it would say something like repeat weekly on Thursday on completion date Now having day of the week and also from completion date makes no sense so was curious what the app would do set my Tuesday task to repeat every Thursday from completion date and checked it off on Sunday The app should have rescheduled the task for the following Sunday but it didn It scheduled it for the following Tuesday and completely ignored the Thursday and the from completion date Sorry Business Calendar but that just not going to work,1,negative

13551,have to agree that the full screen time draining ads are not viable for Business Calendar regardless of the reasoning behind it By all means keep the small rolling ads along the bottom of the screen or alternatively charge more reasonable fee to go pro is not an option when there are so many other options out there such as aCal which used to use before BC and am now reverting to ll keep an eye on Business Calendar though because if you change the ad situation or make the pro price more reasonable ll certainly be back,1,negative

274,This is nicely made app and premium is cheap but one critical flaw is the reminder sound runs through the ringtone channel instead of the alarm channel or even the media channel So unless you enjoy hearing every single notification go off on your phone or your ears are super sensitive to vibrations from across the room this app is not fit for purpose shame just pooched my free trial now,1,negative

9430,Awesome app Allows for custom li and allows collaboration on ones you specifiy for group projects ta The interface is clean crisp but also allows you to make it your own by adding color themes to the accents of the task pages The only thing wish this would include is customizable smart list based on certain parameters This would make the app even better though out of the box this has everything you need to get your ta and projects done,2,neutral

2753,really like this app it one of the best reminder apps there is However the new custom notifications are horrible It sticks out like sore thumb You have to manually set between white or black background which means that they don automatically switch with Android dark mode They re also not black but grey which makes them look ugly next to other notifications Title and time also don line up with other notifications Plus it says min ago which is only accurate if look at my phone immediately And it turns on the screen when the notification comes in even if it in my pocket This is great app but the recent update is one of those if it ain broken don fix it moments really hope you consider going back to standard Android notifications or at least provide an option between custom or standard ll gladly update my review to stars if that happens,1,negative

2055,It is pretty good use it everyday However think adding recurring ta is not very intuitive You have to remember the every syntax Some UI would help especially for new users and non native English speakers Other than that it pretty plain to do list does not include much gamification to keep you motivated to do what you have to do other than setting general goal number of ta to do in day or week Reporting is premium feature which comes in pretty thin too you can only see barchart of how many ta you ve completed each day in the past week or how many ta you ve completed every week in the past weeks For what it offers the premium option feels bit expensive,2,neutral

1955,This app seems great However switched to another app mainly because the reminder alarms and reoccurring task options are locked without premium What the free version let you do is fine but not impressive enough to risk subscription billed annually They should give free premium preview for week or two so this app can showcase itselbetterf Without access to reminders it felt more like note keeping app that had to remember to check which hindered the promised productivity boost,2,neutral

5156,find the concept of this app absolutely stupid don think people are gonna care about if virtual plant dies if use an app and the only thing it does is give notification as an incentive What the app should do is whenever someone opens an app forest should open and display over the app this will prevent others from casually using other apps while their work is in progress,1,negative

14885,With so many free calendar apps out there there just nothing in the free version of this one to make you choose it The only feature that might set it apart from the competition is the project feature but you have to pay to use it Sure you have the notes feature but there are ways to accomplish the same thing in pretty much any other calendar so just can see the point Rather than pay for an upgrade to an app that just ho hum the view isn even very customizable ll be uninstalling,1,negative

15346,love that the app interface is so easy to use The reason don give it stars is because you can export notes It would be ideal if that could be done,2,neutral
5230,Right after installing noticed that whitelisting apps is such an important and basic feature which you made available only for premium users This is such ridiculous decision for google play editor choice app that im not even gonna bother trying your app any more than minute Update No it unacceptable that your development team didn predict the flow of new installations and didn include any kind of trial period but fine ll up my rating to neutral,2,neutral

12119,This is the perfect calendar app And its gorgeous to boot,2,neutral

5322,It is an extremely good app But it keeps crashing Have installed it for the rd time in days,2,neutral
5561,This app is good but it will be extra good if the developer put an option to continous timing for focus believe there should not be any kind of limit like min Remove it or give an option to set custom time in hour and minute,2,neutral
9389,was skeptical at first but wow Yes the req to have Microsoft account didn thrill me but this has all the features Wunderlist did and more you just need to find them You CAN move the order of ta manually just do an extra long tap on the task and drag There is also an inbox here it is just called ta This app is much more flexible in terms of themes than Wunderlist was and it makes it really easy to both delete ta and steps within task Switching was easy too,2,neutral

12586,This app has great potential but is not there yet Example if task repeats but without notification then you manually mark it completed The task is shown as completed should advance to the next scheduled date Instead it is showing up the next day as past due But if the task repeats with notification then on the due date time the tem instantly advances the due date but does not show the task as completed so you have no record of the task due today have overlooked many Not good,2,neutral

4428,Great idea and enjoying it so far Chores and errands are much more fun My one gripe so far is that it seems like most items que cost gems which are pay to play afraid ll pretty quickly run out of free items que to strive for and then the app will lose its effectiveness It be helpful if their were other ways to unlock gems outside of paying for them like reaching extra high levels of productivity habit building etc,2,neutral

343,Day of trialling this So far ve had two location reminders fail can label location with more than one letter the only time based reminder that fired did so while on phone call so don know what it sounds like not that can change the sound anyway because the instructions don work had no idea what the buttons meant so the first one tapped the task got snoozed for hours How is that typical snooze length Adding anything more than basic list item is not intuitive,1,negative

11351,There are lot of really cool feature with this app but stopped using it almost as soon as started because of one key missing feature the calendar view It weird to me that planner app doesn have calendar view It has calendar sync option if you pay for it but not going to buy it only to find out that is not what want Could also be greatly improved if it included ta and projects Really awesome functionality but missing some core essentials for me,2,neutral

6858,It the best habit tracker out there but it not the best it can possibly be After substantial amount of thought succumbed and shelled out the euros for the premium version to be able to use the widget which is essential to keep me on track However the widget doesn respond unless the application is opened beforehand so minus one star for that Also true black widget or user interface would be very nice for AMOLED screens so fingers crossed for that too,2,neutral

9964,The app is fine but the widget never became available on my phone or watch The widget was the whole reason used this app,1,negative
7366,This is re review This could be the best habit tracker goal setter and task manager with some really great features like nested li and smart auto grouping and very versatile repeat task setup Just don confuse the game in RPG for any actual gameplay but it does have very elaborate character design and advancement tem that deserves recognition allowing for well rounded and unique hero which grows with every task performed in the user daily life However Do It Now does hamstring itself by overlooking some very important integral functionality Firstly there is no way to order the ta set out in any of the groups After solid month of use building some projects with subta which had subta and setting up several habit based routines the lack of prioritisation or task ordering created confusing clutter of items which looked no different from the next While auto grouping and smart grouping should have been able to help sort that out the lack of ability for the user to remove any task from these groups meant every task appeared once again losing the important ones in the clutter User defined groups could only contain the items specifically placed in them but once again large project with number of different aspects can not be ordered into sensible linear series With no social aspect currently attached to the app as at ver there is no task sharing There is also no designated pc mac linux front end for desktop syncing Finally it expensive as apps go one off of will get the full version or about month paid yearly which removes ads and gives calendar access Original review good way to make the tedium of self regulation bit more fun Being able to plan to skip things when away from regular activities is handy It would be nice to see characteristic and skill based modifiers affect related task improvements as they raise and subtask attached leader,2,neutral

12731,decent to do list app EXCEPT for the ads understand ads are necessary and accept that But forced full screen ads with sound that even when they are done don let you close them and force you to the play store If you back up out of the play store the ad starts all over again,2,neutral

6837,Excellent app Does everything you want habit tracking app to do Only complaint is the app counts the current day in your progress with no option to change that So it looks like you are less successful than you really have been on daily activity done near the end of each day For example if am tracking going to the gym after work everyday and have been successful for weeks the app will show me as less than successful until indicate today is successful Need to fix that,2,neutral

6204,DO NOT BUY PREMIUM Version App stopped synching and is no longer supported got Premium to sync to new phone since ve been using the app for over year and wanted to keep tracking wasted Very disappointing because basic version is great simple but fully functional and effective for tracking up to habits Good visuals and the ability to make notes Premium tracking habits and syncing across devices but no more Would be stars if still supported and worked,1,negative
2725,When editing or deleting recurring task it should ask if you re doing it just for this task or all recurring ta instead of deleting and editing all ta without asking when creating recurring task should be able to time it on different times for each reccuring day instead of having to create the same reccuring task for each seperate day,1,negative
4290,Incredibly useful service and thanks so much for creating it The app tends to be buggy but nothing that couldn easily be worked around until the last update Since the last update drag and drop sorting of To Do and pect Dailies as well subta checkli no longer works which is really frustrating At least the website works great as always It just frustrating to have to run down to the computer to fix my li,2,neutral
4334,would be happy to give the app five star rating as have reaped many benefits directly relate to my usage of Habitica but am prevented from doing so by recent events can only give you three star rating because suddenly your application no longer functions with no warning or information as to why or how to fix it characters is not enough to relay proper data on this issue to the Dev Team likely by design and for that blame Google Play not the Dev Team of Habitica,2,neutral
383,good shared ta but app itself makes me angry it keeps forgetting am logged in with my google account so need to login for like each two weeks or so and it also forgets my settings Edit unfortunately this has not been fixed yet even though had sent logs and communicated with you Decreasing my rating,1,negative
7485,the app itself is wonderful idea but the interface and functions need lot of work in my opinion it took me so long to figure out how to set up habit and still don understand how to use task groups or steps gave up and came back to my previous tracker because it was too complicated and time consuming to learn how to use this one Anyway will definitely retry after an update,2,neutral

3801,Good app but very buggy and support is completely unhelpful There no way to change your subscription level in the app or play store Even if you cancel the app will think you re still subscribed So basically when you pick subscription level you are fully committed to it because the devs are too incompetent and uncaring to help When using choosing skill the habits dailies show up like of the time and the devs basically said oh well we can fix that when mentioned it,1,negative
5455,This is good app,2,neutral
15310,am running this app on Droid Turbo with stock Lollipop installed The app has very nice layout but unfortunately find it to be very buggy It is impossible to create an event that includes Monday and the app can import recurring events from Google calendar have reported these to the developers and hope the app is cleaned up soon,2,neutral
12952,like the way it separates li sub li horizontally and can switch between them conveniently with swipes though tend to accidentally delete ta when trying to switch li value the convenience of swipe to delete the most being able to quick add ta from the main screen removes one extra tap step being able to highlight important ta but wish it would automatically pin them to the top Feature wish most for Image attachments Idea Location based reminders,2,neutral
6859,The one major short coming of this app and most other habit trackers is that it does not have any option to calculate total number amount of hours etc for week or month only number of days or per day That is gaping deficit in these app with the exception of one or two with less desirable formats as it is far better way to track things like sleep which may fluctuate from day to day The other dismaying factor is that Habitbull doesn seem to have any customer service as mailed numerous times about issues trying to upgrade because it is really helpful useful application and never got any response in about year time Aside from the tabulation inadequacy discussed above which really hope they ll address include that capability it is really helpful and useful app and can be especially helpful for people with issues such as depression or OCD who may have difficulty keeping handle on self care and or productivity though it could also have the opposite effect if people with OCD get too immersed in tracking things in their day to day In general it is good tool to have though and can help you make lot of progress on things like household projects etc but really do wish that they adjust it so that you can calculate total for duration of time longer than day and that they would also be conscientious about customer service support and responding to fielding correspondence and issues people encounter Kristin Star,2,neutral

4713,really like this app it pleasing on the eyes it well designed has lot of social features but remains simple so you can focus on your goals not running the app would suggest to add an ability for gold that is currency only valuable to you so that your personal rewards aka don work against playing with your avatar and currency of that kind should be able to be exchanged within party That way you and your friends can gift each other screen time or whatever,2,neutral

1431,used Todoist Premium for about years but must say that it has gone down over the years There are so many features missing compared to other similar apps which are either free or charge much less for their premium version The new major update feels like complete let down with absolutely no new features other than now being able to see subta in the parent task dialog box Still no Kanban view no native calendar view limited to no sorting options just to name few sorry but dabbing bit of color on icons or adding color name next to color do not qualify as new features left Todoist for TickTick couple of months ago and have not looked back,1,negative
6868,suggest positive running tab amd also negative running tab love the app and it really makes difference in tracking my daily habits the only thing have found that would make it better is if could track relap this would require it to allow something that do NOT want to mark for day amd when it is marked then it would be negative this would help responsibility to be accounted for the relapse would like these negstives to be separateky counted from the positive marks,2,neutral

685,Much better since my last review in Right now easily the best to do app out there All the issues faced back then are gone One thing that makes this star above average app rather than average is the automatic inclusion of past due ta in Today list Of course if it past due it has to be due today Somehow most to do apps miss this stars will be when or if they actually release the google tant integration and it actually works without issues That Zapier stuff though what joke If anyone has the time to deal with that they have plenty of extra time and have no need for to do app Also including zapier as premium feature with zapier itself requiring an expensive subscription to actually work is pretty damn dick move Yea just thought about this again and this dick move co star Pay for star extra DLC,2,neutral

7446,This is re review This could be the best habit tracker goal setter and task manager with some really great features like nested li and smart auto grouping and very versatile repeat task setup Just don confuse the game in RPG for any actual gameplay but it does have very elaborate character design and advancement tem that deserves recognition allowing for well rounded and unique hero which grows with every task performed in the user daily life However Do It Now does hamstring itself by overlooking some very important integral functionality Firstly there is no way to order the ta set out in any of the groups After solid month of use building some projects with subta which had subta and setting up several habit based routines the lack of prioritisation or task ordering created confusing clutter of items which looked no different from the next While auto grouping and smart grouping should have been able to help sort that out the lack of ability for the user to remove any task from these groups meant every task appeared once again losing the important ones in the clutter User defined groups could only contain the items specifically placed in them but once again large project with number of different aspects can not be ordered into sensible linear series With no social aspect currently attached to the app as at ver there is no task sharing There is also no designated pc mac linux front end for desktop syncing Finally it expensive as apps go one off of will get the full version or about month paid yearly which removes ads and gives calendar access Original review good way to make the tedium of self regulation bit more fun Being able to plan to skip things when away from regular activities is handy It would be nice to see characteristic and skill based modifiers affect related task improvements as they raise and subtask attached leader,2,neutral

7368,used to use Habitica and must say this is great step up like to see more social features such as sharing ta only one person has to perform said task for it to be checked off but only giving that person the experience and gold Otherwise the price for subscription is too steep thus resulting in sub perfect score could easily justify month or eternal subscription for If that price could be met as well as fine tuning this would be easily worth stars,2,neutral
11622,Good app but it needs more work gave it four stars because its missing premium selection that is an overview of your activities so one can see total time spent on what This could be in form of pie bar or line chart You can include all so we have choice With this anyone can now keep track of time spent on daily activity and limit time spent on said activity So far good work work guys,2,neutral

8554,have hope that this app will get lot closer to the superior Wunderlist so ll change my review when it does but for now here are my biggest concerns really don like how my day doesn automatically include things due today Also when moving task to list it annoying because the li are not shown under their folders also like to see my week feature Also two li can have the same name even though have them in different folders,0,negative
10541,bought the pro version and like it so far For now what really missing is the ability to change days from the widget itself with the left and right arrows and not only from inside the app Why wouldn you enable the left and right arrows to change day as default Having to go into the app to review past or coming days defeats the purpose of the widget and forces you to use something else other than the widget itself Other than that the app seems to be very practical If the ability to swipe from one day to the next day or to the last day from the widget gets implemented it would be star app for me Thanks,2,neutral
345,It sorely needs and UNDO backup restore revert feature in case we accidentally touch swipe circle bullet which then gets unintentionally deleted immediately which find incredibly frustrating It also needs flexible feature to import export other common text data formats like CSV XML events to from calendar not just copy reminders to ta If Google fixes all that then give it stars,1,negative

2116,The app is excellent simple streamlined functional to do list However the newly redesigned widget gives me heck of lot less control How do select and reschedule group of ta How do open the app from the widget so don need both the widget and an icon If wanted to do complex editing could easily open the app and the widget could do things the app couldn Give it back,2,neutral
10026,updated was confused that the event list in the actual app wasn showing events scheduled for the next few days The widget will only show events in the next The event list in the app also only shows events in the next think this list should list events for that entire day this means still depend on other apps for an agenda view,2,neutral

4465,just starting out with Habitica and am liking it so far but the To Dos would be much more useful if they could be organized by due date ve got like things on that list with due dates over the next two weeks or so and it would be much easier to actually accomplish these things if could easily see which were the most urgent instead of having to scroll up and down and compare dates in mental tally,2,neutral

7079,Well like anything this app is only as useful as you re willing to let it be BUT if you are committed to either making or breaking or both any habit you can think of then this little jewel of an app can help you do that The idea of streaks may seem trivial to some but we all crave this at some level because it clearly marks out your accomplishments in tangible way When you see you have days of success you are that much more likely to overcome the impediments you may face What more this program is highly flexible in the ways you can track any given habit have yet to find habit and pattern couldn set up The app is free although paid for the premium version because HATE ads and liked the flexibility of data export so just try it and you may find that it changes your life for the better,2,neutral

5222,kinda miss the old tem where time specific trees styles were the thing Now you can pick anything after focusing for minutes It actually takes away incentive to study focus longer Nitpick the bracketed week has no space after the day example Monday week instead of Monday Week Nitpick sharing It would be nice to share more than just an image of the forest Perhaps some tree stats Much like there is underneath the forest itself,2,neutral
4,Absolutely worthless This app runs prohibitively clunky interface that effectively voids the promise of ease of life automation Google Calendar will provide all other services promised by Any do for free with no annual subscription rate Don sign up for the free trial It not worth getting pinged for forty bucks when you decide you don like it and forget to cancel it in time Save your money,0,negative
