7447,used to use Habitica and must say this is great step up like to see more social features such as sharing ta only one person has to perform said task for it to be checked off but only giving that person the experience and gold Otherwise the price for subscription is too steep thus resulting in sub perfect score could easily justify month or eternal subscription for If that price could be met as well as fine tuning this would be easily worth stars,2,neutral

3509,It has made me more productive than ever,2,neutral
7464,The fact there are no predefined ta makes it super hard to use Or rather this will work if user can just define the task quest easily Or maybe we can import by purchasing some set of que For me it is still quite confusing and hard to manage with all the options offered would be use it furthere more if not too complicated,2,neutral
8114,It is great app But still there is space for some improvement The calendar for example you have one to add more ta other to see each specific task and the days that you did the job but note one to see the sum of all ta You should create resume calendar where can see the percentage of jobs that accomplished in each day,2,neutral
14036,gave it lower rating because lately if had any repeat scheduled appointments can change one without changing them all Very aggravating Before was able to cancel one without affecting all the future repeat weekly or monthly entries Before could use this calendar to keep track of my past activities Now it looks like attended meeting when didn because couldn cancel it without affecting future meetings,2,neutral

7207,Crippled version without even way to purchase outright EDIT ll be clearer Many apps features are disabled But there is no way to just buy the app The only option is some ongoing payment subscription which makes no sense as this app does not provide any ongoing or backend service it just an app and simple one at that It like going to buy water bottle and going to check out they take your credit card info and charge you the same price every year that you use the bottle Bottom line it just scummy business practice,0,negative
9644,No longer work in Android It can load meetings from Outlook or even from Google accounts Interface is badly designed too,0,negative
4209,It fun great concept but the app itself needs work It locks up constantly and has to be manually shut down and then re started and the reminders basically don work at all Honestly think it would be best to remove the reminder feature for now until it can be fixed because not having way to set one at all is better than using the feature and thinking you ll get needed reminder when you won because it doesn actually work,2,neutral
2088,Easy to Navigate with simple task input and completion of task Sense of accomplishment like it so far,2,neutral
3204,It is very good app to manage your to do list One thing that can make it better is it should show all the incomplete or overdue taks with todays ta as overdue instead of into inbox This will make those task more accessible and will keep them under notice,2,neutral

9787,have been using the fully unlocked version of this application for over year This is fantastic app However it lacks the capability to sync with outlook calendars For example if have subscribed to my work outlook calendar in Google calendar the events will not be synchronized with Sectograph This would be fine if this was the documented behavior of this application However subscribed outlook calendars are selectable from the calendar selection menu,1,negative

6847,Habitbull is great love how customizable it is for making different types of habits Tracking my current streak is great for motivating me to keep on going And even if break my streak love that it shows my best score so have new goal to reach The only thing would suggest is having user suggestions button in the settings have emailed about new type of habit couple times and have never heard anything back User feedback is always good for making great app even better,2,neutral

491,Excellent app with plenty of functionality for free users and worthy upgrades for paid users love that it can be used across multiple platforms That being said it super unreliable so never upgrade Repeated ta sometimes get marked off and stay on the current day needing to be marked completed as many as before moving to the next day Sometimes when you add task it ll disappear maybe related to server syncing But not always so you better remember defeats the purpose,2,neutral

5836,ve tried plenty of pomodoro esque apps and this one is the standout Planting trees actually keeps me interested in focusing longer without distracting me from my work bought the premium upgrade months ago and haven looked back My one suggestion would be to work in break times Typical pomodoro is work mins break for work again etc Maybe have popup asking if want min break every mins popup that can easily be ignored if want to continue working instead,2,neutral

10005,This app is actually wonderful hoping you can add the forward and backward buttons on the widget potentially just as another available function of those virtual buttons like we have access to in the full app It would be nice to click forward through the calendar and then say click the clock center to refresh and reload with the current time,2,neutral
