3991,wanted to use this app The concept is really good But won use it simply because it barely functions For starters it online only but as if that wasn enough the sync on Android is just all over the place the app would sometimes ask have you done these things today for ta that were scheduled the day before or at AM for ta on that day Speaking of ta couldn set up multiple repeating ta for certain days of the week per task wanted to fill the whole week with various ta and repeat them for some reason they would all sync to same weekdays enabled reminders but never had reminder come up once and as far as researched online this is common problem on Android and hasn been resolved for some time So it seems have to create habit of opening this habit tracker app,1,negative

2751,Has been one of the best reminder app available for long time This most recent update messed up notifications on Android They don follow the tem dark mode at all instead you have to manually change it in the app or deal with mismatched colors It looks ridiculous seeing white notification background amidst other black backgrounds in dark mode It also looks like the black is not true black like other apps If this isn fixed soon ll be looking for new reminder app,1,negative

5217,The app idea is great on itself However there are too many options blocked behind the pro version which one would think are basic whitelist and exporting the progress changing phones makes all the progress be lost Moreover although not essential some free achievements would also be nice even if they don give any coins willing to change my rating if see any of those changes since like said the app is quite good already free version feels like less than free trial,2,neutral

11626,really like this app The concept of blocking your times is great and find it helps me structure my time really well It also load off of my mind knowing that don need to think about when to eat or what time to check my email because am at ease knowing it all planned for and will be informed accordingly My only disappointment with the service and not the app is that am unable to structure my timeline online on PC think there are limitations of the mobile device that makes the scheduling somewhat confusing think it will be perfect to incorporate way to set up your schedule on nice large screen and use your phone for viewing and notifications,2,neutral

1650,The UI is neat with pleasing graphics It is straightforward to use no frills just wish it can accomodate people and the notes feature is available to use it is premium feature but it would be nice if there is character limit as compromise The app supports syncing with calendars But imo todoist calendar option will be better no added step of linking and maintaining the other calendar data integrity All in all this is an app with potential,2,neutral
12321,do not like the functionality of the app found it is very easy to delete sub list But if you create second list could not figure out how to delete it after going through all settings also did not like the fact that you can only add one item within the sub list Other people may be okay with these nuances but for me it not only use this app for about half an hour and then deleted it,0,negative
5958,Very simple good for keeping you away from your phone Also planting trees is the best for the environment because plants keep animals alive and animals keep plants going by herbivores eating plants then pooping out seeds and predators keep herbivores in check so they don eat to many plants it symbiotic relationship Keep this up,2,neutral

12562,Its not bad app at all but it could be better If you could keep track of how often you complete task that would be better Like if you checked off every time you shampooed your hair it would be nice to keep track so you can change how much you shampoo if needed Also feel like having bar at the top to switch between li makes more sense than the way it is now You should still give it try if you need something like this because you might like it better than did,2,neutral
8170,Handy habit helper,2,neutral
3351,It is very good app to manage your to do list One thing that can make it better is it should show all the incomplete or overdue taks with todays ta as overdue instead of into inbox This will make those task more accessible and will keep them under notice,2,neutral

14719,thought upgrading and paying the fee would allow me to use all of the functions of this app It does not Haven been able to sync any of my devices Absolutely will not let me add an event This was waste of time and money If can add my schedule on my lap top version then there no point to this app Plus there no support or anyone to contact to help trouble shoot or credit me back,0,negative
